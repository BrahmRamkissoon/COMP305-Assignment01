Assignment01 2D Space Shooter

Using the Space Shooter Tutorial 
(http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial), you will create your own 2d arcade game. 
The game must include enemies for the player to avoid and/or destroy. A scoring system must also be included. 
You must use your own graphic and sound assets (not the assets included with the Space Shooter Tutorial)
